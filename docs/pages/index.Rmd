# Introduction
The course will give an overview of R as an instrument for programming and efficient scripting, with a twist on using it to analyze biologically relevant data.
It will start with the basics and then develop into an exploration of ways to improve code performance and structure.
All of the materials from the lectures can be found [here](https://www.ceredalab.com/SPC/index.html), with relevant information related to the authors as well.

The course, which lasted one week, has been thaught by U. Pozzoli, F. Iannelli and M. Cereda at [IEO](https://www.research.ieo.it/) in Milan.
