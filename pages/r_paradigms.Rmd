## Data Structures
### Vectors
In R, we can have beginner data structures (i.e. vectors, matrices and dataframes) and more advanced structures (i.e. S3, S4 and RC).
Simpler data structures can further be subset into *homogeneous* or *heterogeneous* data structures.
Below we can find a representative diagram of data structure relationships in R.

::: {align="center"}
<img src='../pics/data-structures-overview.png' width=500 height=400 alt="Data structure relationship in R"/>
:::

**Atomic vectors** and **lists** are both mono-dimensional data types which differ due to the type of data they can contain, one is formed by elements of the same type, while lists are heterogeneous.
Operations based on vectors in R are element-wise, meaning that vector-vector operations are done element by element (*with the shorter vector being recycled*) while scalar-vector operations broadcast the operation to each single element of a vector.
In R, atomic vectors can be created using the _vector constructor_ `c()`.

The important thing about vectors is the fact that they can be indexed to extract specific elements and can be concatenated together.

```{r}
# Vector concatenation and indexing
vec_a <- c(0,1,2,3,4,5)
vec_b <- c(28,3,45,2)
vec_c <- c(0,1)

# Concatenate
fvec <- c(vec_a, vec_b, vec_c, 67, 9)

# Index vector and extract 3rd element (remember that R is 1-based)
fvec[3]
```
R is known for being a language with **vectorized** operations, this is crucial when implementing vector operations since taking advantage of this feature can dramatically speed up code. Some of these functionalities are shown below.

```{r}
# Vectorized addition with a scalar
fvec + 3

# Vector-vector addition
fvec + c(rep(2,length(fvec)))

# Vector-vector multiplication
fvec * c(rep(2,length(fvec)))
```

### Structure and attributes
Of course when adding together vectors we need to make sure that the elements of the addition are of the same length. But what about the underlying vector representation in R? We can access this information by using the utility function `str` and access an object's attributes.

```{r}
# In R, we can function the structure function to check for the structure of the data 
# This coerces the integer
v <- c('q', 1, 'a', 2)

# Look at structure
str(v)

# Additionally, we can set attributes to values for variables
'a_name' <- attr(v, 'my_attribute')
```

### Approximations
Another functionally important aspect is to remind ourselves of the existance of approximations in calculations, in this case if we type the following:

```{r}
x <- (sqrt(2))**2
x - 2 # Should return 0 but it does not
```

This happens due to the approximation that the machine provides, and this is why we need to pay a great deal of attention when using conditionals with `== 0`.
This is partially rescued by the use of a function like the one `dplyr::near()`.

Hand in hand with this concept is the one of *coercion*, by which object get converted from their original class to other classes.
This in R happens either *implicitly* or *explicitly*.

### Creating number sequences
Creating sequences of numbers in R is fairly straightforward with many different functions available and we can generate both random sequences, repeated sequences or specific distributions (normal, poisson or others) by specifying the needed parameters.

```{r}
# Genrate 100 random doubles from 0 to 10
dbls <- runif(100, min=0, max=10)

# Sample 100 values from a standard normal distribution
dbls <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)

# Generate 100 random outcomes from a coin flip using a Bernoullu trial
dbls <- rbinom(100, size=1, prob=0.5)

# Sample 100 values from a negative binomial distribution with size and prob values
dbls <- rnbinom(100, size=1, prob=0.75)
```

### Matrices
Two-dimensional data in R is represented by the `Matrix` class and can be constructed using the following code.

```{r}
# Create a matrix
mat <- matrix(runif(60), ncol=3)

# Assign different dimensions
dim(mat) <- c(3,20) # 3 rows 20 cols

# Isolate the upper triangle of the matrix in index form
idxs <- upper.tri(mat, diag = FALSE)
```

Matrices can be also manipulated to get their diagonal and triangles by using dedicated functions.

```{r}
# Generate a matrix
m <- matrix(runif(10), ncol = 5)

# Diagonal 
diag(m)

# Upper triangle
upper.tri(m, diag = TRUE)
```

Additionally, we can exploit functions which combine vectors to generate matrices.

```{r}
x <- c(0,2,4,5)
y <- c(2,5,6,4)

# bind vector into matrix as rows
rbind(x, y)

# bind as columnn
cbind(x, y)
```

### Matrix operations
In R, matrix-matrix operations are run _element-wise_, so they have to happen between uniform and consistent, meaning of the same dimensions. Expanding on operations, matrix multiplication in R is achieved with the operator `%*%` as such:

::: {align="center"}
<img src='../pics/matrix_multiplication.png' width=400 height=400/>
:::

```{r}
# Create matrices
x <- matrix(runif(10), ncol = 5)
y <- matrix(runif(5), nrow = 5)

# rows by col matrix multiplication
matmul <- x %*% y

matmul
```

### Lists
Lists are probably the most programmatically complex objects in R, they contain different types and have different lenght with or without named elements.
They represent the very first interface to **Object-oriented programming**. Lists are tricky to work with when mixing data types since they can include _silent coercion_.

## Object-Oriented (OO) data type
### Classes in general
Here we are moving from basic structures to objects which can contain data and are associated to methods which are able to operate on the data itself.
It is a mode of operation borrowed from C++.
A **class** contains *methods* and *attributes*, the whole creates one of the main instances of OOP.
Class elements can inherit from other objects which share the same parent.
The main thing to understand is that R, by default, treats everything as an object.
Everything, literally *everything*, has attributes and maybe even methods, from basic vectors to complex classes.

```{r}
vec <- c(1,2,3)

# Illustrate classes
class(vec)

# Coerce vector to another class as well, so that methods designed with that class im mind, can be applied to this object as well
class(vec) <- append(class(vec), 'SPC')

# Now vec will have both classes listed
class(vec)
```

The way we can think of classes in R is that they are description of things in a specific methods system and are defined by the `setClass()` function in the `methods` package (in S4).
An object is an instance of a class, these can be created using the `new()` function.
Finally a method is a function operating *only* on a certain class of objects, in this sense a `generic` function is one which *dispatches methods*, this means that they do not perform any computation, they just figure out the class of the data and matches it with an appropriate method.
Generics can of course be created and a developer might create associated methods.
For S3 system objects there is also a `methods` function which lets the user explore methods implemented for the function.

### Class systems
By default, R has three object oriented systems, one is **S3**, it implements classes without defining them strictly but instead defines functions and methods separately across classes.
The main functional aspect related to S3 is the ability to *overload functions*, this means that one function can be swiftly applied to different class elements and behave correctly.
S3 functions are by design split into `generics` and `methods` and are defined in the code by using `generic.class`.

```{r}
# Example of an S3 defined (generic) function is print
print

# Call methods function on a generic function, in this case mean
methods('mean')
```

S3 pre-dates S4 both in terms of time and functionality, S3 methods system is less rigorous and informal, this called for a more formalized approach tackled by S4.

We can explicitly access the code behind an S3 method definition by doing the following:

```{r}
head(getS3method('mean', 'default'))
tail(getS3method('mean', 'default'))
```

This shows the inner functionality of the S3 method behind `mean`.
Interestingly, the `.Internal` at the very end is used to fetch C code which adds functionality to the method.

**S4** formally defines classes, while **RC** (reference class) binds also the methods and has a very similar approach to classes in C++.
In the below code we can see how, differently from S3, an S4 method does not have ellipses in the `standardGeneric` function since it takes on standardized input invariably.

```{r}
# Print out an S4 function
show
```

Classes in R can be defined using the `structure()` function by doing something like `foo <- structure(list(), class = 'my_class')` and then from there we can start building methods for the class by specifying functions operating on the structure.
A hierarchy of sorts can be visualized as follows, first we have a class, then in **S3** methods are below functions, which in turn are separated from the class specification (like class and attributes in python).
**RC** style objects are the ones closer to the object-oriented programming way of C++, here methods and attributes are packaged within the class.

### Creating an S4 Class
Now, as an example, we will define a simple S4 class for describing a bank account.

```{r}
# Define the S4 class with slots
setClass('bank_account',
         representation('user' = 'character',
                        'balance' = 'numeric'))
```

In this way, we are able to access the slots of the class with the `@` operator, which is specifically reserved to access S4 class slots.
Let's now create a new method which allows the updating of the class object after a money deposit.

```{r}
# A method to update a class 
setGeneric('sum')

setMethod('sum', # specify a generic function 
          'bank_account', # signature
          function(x, deposit) {
            x@balance <- x@balance + deposit
          })

# If we call methods on print we should see the new method as well
showMethods('sum')
```

Now let's try the new class in action and apply the defined method to an object!

```{r}
# Create a new bank account with user and balance
ba <- new('bank_account', user = 'Mattia', balance = 100)

# Add a deposit (if this was a Ref Class then updates could happen inplace)
ba@balance <- sum(ba, 200)

# Print out new value
ba@balance
```

### Working with filesystems
In R, we are able to work with files by interacting with the host OS and filesystem in I/O workflows and pipelines.
The function `read.table()` is a built-in which helps the user to read files.
In addition, by using `write.table()` we can save a table object with a specified name and separator.
R also provides a specific function to `dump()` a whole environment image into a variable which can be save, although this is highly inefficient.

Additionally the `tidyverse`, through `readr`, provides a faster interface to achieve the same I/O management.

An interesting binary file format to save objects in R but which can be read by any other programming languages is the one provided by the `feather` library.

## Working with Data
### Vectorized functions
Base R functions for manipulating basic data structures are many.
One of the most potent family of functions in R is the `*apply` one.
In this case we can iterate over elements of a list or columns of a dataframe iteratively by applying a custom function without the need to declare it explicitly outside.

```{r}
# Use apply over a list
l = list(   1:5
          , c("a","b")
          , c(T,F,T,T) )

# apply length to the list elements
lapply(l, length)
```

Then we can operate over dataframe numerical columns extracting correlation values like the following, using the function `pairs()`.

```{r}
## quick graphical overview by the scatterplot matrix
d <- data.frame('id'=runif(100), 'score'=runif(100), 'value'=runif(100))

pairs(d[,c("id", "score","value")]
      , lower.panel = panel.smooth
      , upper.panel = NULL)
```

### Operations on Matrices
Operations on numerical 2D data like matrices can be operated upon by using a couple of very powerful functions like `scale()` and `sweep()`.

```{r}
# Showcase the functions above
m = matrix(round(runif(9),2),nr=3,nc=3) 

# Scale (mean 0 and variance 1)
scale(m, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

# Sweep (apply a vector over a matrix summarizing an operation)
# median value of each row of the matix
row.med <- apply(m, MARGIN = 1, FUN = median)
# subtracting the median value of each row
sweep(m, MARGIN = 1, STATS = row.med, FUN = "-")
```
## The Tidyverse 
Of course the functionality of many of these functions has been superseded and augmented by the ones provided by the `dplyr` package, at least in terms of operating over dataframes.

## Code optimization and performance testing in R
### Variable scoping
Functions in R map a repetitive behaviour onto an input and generate a return value.
In R, `.Primitive` is used to call a function from the underlying C language, an example of this is `sum()`, as seen below.

```{r}
sum
```

In functions, **scoping** refers to how a value is assigned to an environment variable, this will test whether the variable already exists or not and whether the variable exists in a parent or child environment. More specifically, coping is the set of rules that control the way R picks up the value of a variable
Scoping is divided in both _static_ and _dynamic_.
In static scoping we can have four basic principles including _name masking_, by which if a name is not defined inside a function, R will look for it in the parent environment. _Functions and variables_ since the same rules apply if a function is defined within another function.
Another feature is _dynamic lookup_, by which we can have multiple assignments to the same value along the code since static scoping determines _where_ to look for values and not when. This means that R looks for values when a function is run and not when it is created, which in turn means that **the output of a function can be different depending on objects outside its environment**.

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 3

# Demonstrate name masking
fun <- function(){
  x * y  
}

fun()

# Demonstrate dynamic look-up
dl <- function(){
  x <- x + 1
}

# first value
x <- 0
dl()

# second value
x <- 2
dl()
```

### Exception handling
In the case we end up calling a variable inside a function which does not exists, R will throw an error since it cannot find the variable anywhere in the function or in the parent environment.
We can check the existance of variables by using `exist()` while the correct passing of an argument can be checked with the `missing()` function within an `if` statement. This can be coupled with a `stop()` function in order to stop code execution.

```{r}
# Missing check + Stop check
foo = function(x,y,...){
  if (missing(y)){
    
    # STOP
    stop("y is not specified, please STOP\n")
    
    }else{
     print(x)
     print(y)
     args = list(...)
     if("z" %in% names(args)) print(args$z)
  }
}
```

This concept extends to *condition handling and recovery* with the `try()` and `catch()` couple of commands.
Additionally, by using `tryCatch()` we can extend this behaviour further by encapsulating both command, warning and error in the same function which will decide between warning or error and eventually return custom error messages.

```{r}
# tryCatch demonstration
foo = function(z,
               warning = function(w) {
                 print( paste('warning:',w) );
                 },
                error = function(e) {
                 print(paste('error:',e));
               }
               
               ){
        tryCatch(
          { 
          print(paste("attempt log operation for z:",z))
          return(log(z))
          }
          ,warning = warning
          ,error = error )
  }

# Execution
foo(2)
```

The functionality of `tryCatch()` can be coupled with _program re-starts_ in order to be able to run the function again with the substitution of input values gracefully. This is achieved by combining `tryCatch()`, `invokeRestart()` and `withRestarts()`. Sample code for this behaviour is found below.

```{r}
foo = function(z,
               
               ## WARNING FUNCTION with restart
               warning = function(w) {
                 print( paste('warning:',w) );
                 invokeRestart("correctArgForWarnings")
                 },
               
               ## ERROR FUNCTION with restart
               error = function(e) {
                 print(paste('error:',e));
                 invokeRestart("correctArgForErrors")
               }
               
               ){
  
  ## Loop is repeated until a break is specified
  repeat 
    ## 1. catch errors *********************
    withRestarts(   
     
      ## 2. catch warnings =================
      withRestarts(
        
        ## TRY CATCH BLOCk -----------------
        tryCatch(
          { 
          print(paste("attempt log operation for z:",z))
          return(log(z))
          } # return break the repeat loop
          ,warning = warning
          ,error = error )
          ##------------------------------------
        
        , correctArgForWarnings = function() {z <<- -z} ) 
      ##=================================
      
      , correctArgForErrors = function() {z <<- 1})
       ##*********************************
}

foo(2)
```

Now let's try with an invalid value for a logarithm.

```{r}
# invokes the warning’s handler
foo(-2)
```

### Debugging
In R, there are a few functions which help with debugging functions, we can set a `debug()` function working in order to check the status of a function.
Additionally one can use `browser()` to interrupt execution and check the environment at a specific timepoint or `traceback()` to print the call stack of the last uncaught error.

### Profiling with `rbenchmark`
Also, one can check for function performance and benchmarking with specific libraries in R like `rbenchmark::benchmark()`.
Calling this function, we can manage the avergae execution time and get data from the execution of more than one function altogether.

Optimizing code to make it faster is an iterative process which essentially entails three steps including *finding the bottleneck*, trying to *eliminate it* or substitute it and then *repeat the process* until the code is "fast enough".
These steps are facilitated by profiling the code, some demonstration is present below.

As an example, we can demonstrated the profiling of a [_recursive function_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_function) which calculates a factorial value from an integer. This can be implemented in two ways, either by taking advantage of recursion or by exploiting iteration with `for` loops.

```{r}
# Recursion vs Iteration
fact.recursive = function(n){
  ifelse (n==1, 1, (n * fact.recursive(n-1) ) )
}

fact.it = function(n){
  ans = 1
  for (ii in 2:n) ans = ans * ii
  ans
}
```

The simpler way to obtain a benchmark is to check the _elapsed time_ for the execution of the two functions.

```{r}
# Recursive
system.time(fact.recursive(100))["elapsed"]
```

And now the iteration-based one.

```{r}
# Recursive
system.time(fact.recursive(100))["elapsed"]
```

The main thing is to understand how R handles every calculation, this procedure is known as **profiling** can be achieved in R by different means and packages.
We can demonstrate this by applying this workflow to a linear regression setting while using the package `rbenchmark`.

```{r}
library(rbenchmark)

# benchmark() is a simple wrapper around system.time()
benchmark( fact.recursive(15)
          , fact.it(15)
          
          , order="relative"
          , replications=5000
          )
```

## The packaging system in R
### Libraries in r
Packages in R are installed by using either *CRAN* or other public package repositories like *Bioconductor* as we have seen yesterday.
R uses both a system-wide access library (admin privileges needed) and a personal library living in the home directory of the user (usually located at `/usr/local/bin/R`).
The tendency is to use only source code within libraries without relaying on third-party code in order to keep everything contained and requiring only compilation of its own source code.
RStudio is an _IDE_ completely based and dependant on R which allows developers to start a fresh project from a template directory system. In this case we can set a project name and already select eventually present source files from which to start building. Additionally, all code can be promptly synced with an existing or a new git repository to provide efficient tracking of code changes. The same can be achieved in CLI by running `package.skeleton()`. Some source of help useful to understand how to build R packages include the [official R documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) and [Karl Brockman's Primer](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/) (also contains many other interesting tutorials and primers for C++). 

### Generating function docs
In order to automate building effective documentation (which resided in a `.Rd` file for each function contained in the `man` directory) and function annotation, which can become a really painful process, we can rely on the [`Roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) which takes specific annotations in the source code and turns them into function documents respecting the format needed by R. An example of a function with proper `Roxygen2` annotations is the following:

```{r}
# Illustration of Roxygen2 docs

#' A simple and useless function
#' 
#' This function is just here to print stuff out and demonstrate the use of \code{roxygen}. 
#' Use "@param" to list the paramters of the function with descriptions. 
#' Use "@return" to describe the return values of the function. 
#' Use "@export" to export the function in namespace or do not use it if the function is supposed to remain of internal use. 
#' 
#' @param x whatever you want to print out.
#' 
#' @return None
#' 
#' @export

my_fun <- function(x, ...){
  print(x, ...)
}
```
Another important part of R packages is the `NAMESPACE`, which contains instructions on how to export functions when loading a package. This file will also be generated by `Roxygen2` when needed, and the tool will automatically export only the right and needed namespaces (function names). 

### Adding data to packages
Another useful feature that a developer can use while creating a package is the insertion of data as well. This data can be used for testing or use as available datasets for showcasing the package functionalities. This can also be really useful in the case of static files which are sourced from functions within the package.
This documenting of data can also be handled by `Roxygen2` through the creation of another `.Rd` file. In the data definition we can provide a `@docType data` and a `@usage data` to refer to the fact that is data and the way to source it using a function. 

```{r}
# Here's a way to generate some data and store it into a file so that it can be source by a function in the package
# This code should be saved as any other source code, and with the annotations it will generate automatically a .Rd file with documentation

#' Random data loaded inside a package
#' 
#' @docType data
#' 
#' @usage data(random_matrix)

random_matrix <- matrix(runif(100), ncol=10)
```

The above matrix will then be loaded and included in the worskpace after the package has been loaded and can be called using `random_matrix` as a variable, the same way that `mt_cars` is sourced from ggplot's default datasets.

## Web applications with Shiny
### Static vs Dynamic websites
Static websites are called like so since they are deployd but they cannot interact with users in terms of data flow and server requests. Dynamic sites instead allow interactions by using an infrastructure based on _frontend_ and _backend_ structures. One of the most used wrappers for interactive site building in R is [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). 

### Shiny apps
Shiny apps work by separating UI and Server (a live R session) which end up communicating UI requests happening in the frontend to the backend engine.
In Shiny, this crosstalk happens via the creation of a Fluid Page, which is a page type that resizes itself while browsing around. In doing this, Shiny defines a layout that can vary based on the size of the page in a _reactive_ way. 
In practice, this is implemented via two files, a `ui.R` (_user interface_) and a `server.R` (_backend_).

### HTML tags
What Shiny does behind the scenes is to port HTML into R by wrapping up HTML tag creation with R function calls. The main ones for structural design are _panel functions_ whithin which we can group different elements. Panels can be controlled in terms of layout by using layout functions acting within the `FluidPage()` one.

### Interactivity with Widgets
In order to create a dynamic and interactive page in Shiny we can use **Widgets**. Once a widget is defined, it needs to know its imputs and outputs as lists, as well as their location in the server side. An important thing is that server-side inputs should be _read-only_, if inputs are actively modified, then the page will throw an error.
There will always a unique correspondance between input and output in Shiny's _reactive programming_ paradigms since both of them are linked and named across functions.
