This repository hosts a website containing notes from the "Programming in R" course provided in the first year [SEMM PhD](https://www.semm.it/) in Computational Biology.
Since much of the topics of the course were already covered by previous knowledge, this was also a chance to familiarize with the functionalities of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) as a mean to build a static website in concert with GitHub's Pages deployment strategy.
